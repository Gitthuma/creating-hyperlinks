    Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician, computer scientist,
    logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.[6][7] Turing was highly influential in the development
    of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing
    machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer.[8][9][10] Turing is widely considered to be the
    father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.[11] Despite these accomplishments, he was never
    fully recognised in his home country during his lifetime due to the prevalence of homophobia at the time and because
    much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act.
