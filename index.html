    <h3>(23 June 1912 â€“ 7 June 1954)</h3>

    <p>Was an English mathematician, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist" title="Meaning of Computer Scientist">computer scientist</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic" title="Meaning of Logic">logician</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis" title="Meaning of Cryptanalysis">cryptanalyst</a>, philosopher, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_and_theoretical_biology" title="Meaning of Mathematical and Theoretical Biology">theoretical biologist</a>.[6][7] Turing was highly influential in the development
    of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science" title="Meaning of Theoretical Computer Science">theoretical computer science</a>, providing a formalisation of the concepts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm" title="Meaning of Algorithm">algorithm</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation" title="Meaning of Computation">computation</a> with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine" title="What is a turing machine">Turing
    machine</a>, which can be considered a model of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer" title="What is a computer?">general-purpose computer</a>.[8][9][10] Turing is widely considered to be the
    father of theoretical computer science and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" title="Meaning of artificial inteligence">artificial intelligence</a>.[11] Despite these accomplishments, he was never
    fully recognised in his home country during his lifetime due to the prevalence of <a href="">homophobia</a> at the time and because
